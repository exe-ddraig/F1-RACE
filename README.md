# F1-RACE
This C-based project features a secure authentication system and a real-time ASCII racing game, built using the most fundamental concepts. It utilizes modular design, File I/O for data persistence, and the Windows API for flicker-free rendering. Key logic includes collision detection, fuel management, and non-blocking input handling.
